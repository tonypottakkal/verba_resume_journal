# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Local Resume System merges the comprehensive RAG capabilities of Verba with the specialized resume analysis features of Super-people-local to create a unified application for managing, analyzing, and generating professional resumes from work logs and documents. The System SHALL provide document ingestion, semantic search, skills extraction, and AI-powered resume generation in a single, locally-deployable application.
